SwiftFolderCleaner reveals where your disk space goes. Scan any folder to see a visual treemap of file sizes. Filter by type, size, or name. Navigate with breadcrumbs. Delete unwanted files directly. Fast, native, and designed for macOS.

## Description
**SwiftFolderCleaner shows you where your disk space goes.**

Scan any folder to see its contents as a visual treemap. Large files appear as large rectangles. Small files appear small. Colors indicate file type. One glance reveals what's taking up space.

**Features:**

• **Visual Treemap** – Files and folders sized proportionally to disk usage
• **File Type Colors** – Code, documents, images, videos, archives, and more
• **Multiple Filters** – Filter by file type, size range, or filename pattern
• **Quick Navigation** – Click to drill down, use breadcrumbs to navigate back
• **File List View** – Sortable table showing name, size, type, and date
• **File Operations** – Show in Finder or move to Trash
• **Real-Time Scanning** – Watch progress as your folder is analyzed
• **Keyboard Support** – Navigate and operate without touching the mouse

**How It Works:**

1. Click "Scan Folder" and select any directory
2. Watch the scan progress in real time
3. Explore the treemap visualization
4. Filter files by type, size, or name
